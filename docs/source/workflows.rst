Workflows
=========

``cone.app`` uses ``repoze.workflow`` for state based workflows.


Define workflow
---------------

Workflows are described in ZCML. See documentation of ``repoze.workflow`` for
details.

In the ``workflow`` directive, the ``content_types`` attribute contains the
nodes this workflow can be used for.

As ``permission_checker``, ``pyramid.security.has_permission`` is used.

In ``transition`` directives ``cone.app.workflow.persist_state`` is defined
as ``callback``, which sets the ``state`` attribute of the node.

.. code-block:: xml

    <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.repoze.org/bfg">

      <include package="repoze.workflow" file="meta.zcml"/>

      <workflow type="example"
                name="Example workflow"
                state_attr="state"
                initial_state="initial"
                content_types="example.app.model.WorkflowNode"
                permission_checker="pyramid.security.has_permission">
    
        <state name="initial">
          <key name="title" value="Initial state" />
          <key name="description" value="Initial state" />
        </state>

        <state name="final">
          <key name="title" value="Final state"/>
          <key name="description" value="Final state" />
        </state>

        <transition
           name="initial_2_final"
           callback="cone.app.workflow.persist_state"
           from_state="initial"
           to_state="final"
           permission="change_state"
        />

      </workflow>

    </configure>


Use workflow
------------

To use workflows on application model nodes, two plumbing parts are provided.

The first one is ``cone.app.workflow.WorkflowState``, hooking the ``state``
property to node which reads and writes the workflow state to
``node.attrs['state']``.

The second one is ``cone.app.workflow.WorkflowACL``, which alters the
``__acl__`` property of the node. The property computing code first tries to
lookup an ACL explicitly defined for current workflow state. If no ACL for
state is found, the ACL defined in ``default_acl`` is returned. This ACL
permits 'change_state' for roles owner and manager by default.

Also workflow tile related node ``properties`` must be set. As described in
tiles documentation, ``wf_name`` contains the workflow ID, and
``wf_transition_names`` contains a mapping "transition ID -> transition Title"
(needed due to the lack of transition titles in repoze.workflow).

.. code-block:: python

    from plumber import plumbing
    from node.utils import instance_property
    from cone.app.model import BaseNode
    from cone.app.model import Properties
    from cone.app.workflow import WorkflowState
    from cone.app.workflow import WorkflowACL

    @plumbing(WorkflowState, WorkflowACL)
    class WorkflowNode(BaseNode):

        @instance_property
        def properties(self):
            props = Properties()
            props.wf_name = u'example'
            props.wf_transition_names = {
                'initial_2_final': 'Finalize',
            }
            return props


State specific access control
-----------------------------

ACL's defined for specific workflow states are defined in ``state_acls``
attribute of the node by state id.

.. code-block:: python

    class WorkflowNodeWithStateACLs(WorkflowNode):
        state_acls = {
            'initial': [
                (Allow, 'role:manager', ['manage', 'edit', 'change_state']),
                (Allow, Everyone, ['login']),
                (Deny, Everyone, ALL_PERMISSIONS),
            ],
            'final': [
                (Allow, 'role:manager', ['view', 'edit', 'change_state']),
                (Deny, Everyone, ALL_PERMISSIONS),
            ],
        }
