Form basics
===========

``cone.app`` uses YAFOWIL as form library.

Forms are implemented as tiles, registered for specific model nodes. Adding
behavior and form extension of different forms is done with plumbing parts,
see ``plumber`` package for details about the plumbing system.


Form tile
---------

The base class for all form tiles is located at ``cone.app.browser.form.Form``.
This tile is responsible to build the widget tree and to do form processing.

Building the widget tree is done at ``prepare`` time, and form processing is
done when the tile gets called.::

    >>> from yafowil.base import factory
    >>> from cone.tile import tile
    >>> from cone.app.browser.form import Form
    >>> from cone.app.browser.utils import make_url
    >>> from example.app.model import ExampleApp
    
    >>> @tile('someform', interface=ExampleApp, permission="edit")
    ... class SomeForm(Form):
    ... 
    ...     def prepare(self):
    ...         """Prepare YAFOWIL widget tree and set it to ``self.form``
    ...         """
    ...         action = make_url(
    ...             self.request, node=self.model, resource='someform')
    ...         form = factory(
    ...             'form',
    ...             name='someform',
    ...             props={
    ...                 'action': action,
    ...             })
    ...         form['title'] = factory(
    ...             'field:text'
    ...             value=self.model.attrs['title']
    ...             )
    ...         form['save'] = factory(
    ...             'submit',
    ...             props = {
    ...                 'action': 'save',
    ...                 'expression': True,
    ...                 'handler': self.save,
    ...                 'next': None,
    ...                 'label': 'Save',
    ...             })
    ...         self.form = form
    ... 
    ...     def save(self, widget, data):
    ...         value = data.fetch('someform.title').extracted
    ...         self.model.attrs['title'] = value

Forms are AJAX forms by default. If it's desired that a specific form is also
available via traversal, a pyramid view with the name given as ``resource``
parameter when calling ``make_url`` for the form action in the example above
must be provided.::

    >>> from pyramid.view import view_config
    >>> from cone.app.browser.authoring import render_form
    
    >>> @view_config('someform', context=ExampleApp, permission='edit')
    ... def someform(model, request):
    ...     return render_form(model, request, 'someform')


YAMLForm part
-------------

``cone.app.browser.form.YAMLForm`` is a plumbing part which hooks the
``prepare`` function to the form tile building the YAFOWIL form from YAML
definitions. The form implementation from above now looks like::

    >>> from plumber import plumbing
    >>> from cone.app.browser.form import YAMLForm
    
    >>> @tile('someyamlform', interface=ExampleApp, permission="edit")
    ... @plumbing(YAMLForm)
    ... class SomeYAMLForm(Form):
    ... 
    ...     action_resource = u'someyamlform'
    ...     form_template = 'example.app.browser:forms/some_form.yaml'
    ... 
    ...     def save(self, widget, data):
    ...         value = data.fetch('someform.title').extracted
    ...         self.model.attrs['title'] = value

The YAML file which must be present at the given location contains::

    factory: form
    name: someyamlform
    props:
        action: context.form_action
        class: ajax
    widgets:
    - title:
        factory: field:text
        value: expr:context.model.attrs['title']
    - save:
        factory: submit
        props:
            action: save
            expression: True
            handler: context.save
            next: None
            label: Save


CameFromNext part
-----------------

In the examples above we've seen how forms are created, form submission are
processed and forms are rendered. However, a mechanism to handle what happens
after a form actions has been processed successfully is also needed.

This is provided by the plumbing part
``cone.app.browser.authoring.CameFromNext``.

It plumbs to the prepare function and adds a 'came_from' proxy widget to the
already processed form, which can contain either 'parent' or a URL from where
the form was triggered from. If 'came_from' is not found on request, the
application node URL is used.

It extends the form tile by a ``next`` function, which can be defined in form
action definitions as ``next`` property. It also considers 'came_from' on the
request for building the appropriate next URL.

If form was submitted by AJAX call, the ``next`` function returns the desired
AJAX continuation definitions, or an HTTPFound instance used to redirect if
non AJAX request.

Default ajax continuation definitions are an ``AjaxAction`` to render the
``content`` tile to main content area of the page and an ``AjaxEvent``
triggering the context change event, both on target URL resulting by 'came_from'.

Define ``self.next``, respective ``context.next`` if YAML form, in save widget
of form as ``next`` property and add ``CameFromNext`` part to plumbing parts on
form tile class.::

    >>> @tile('someyamlform', interface=ExampleApp, permission="edit")
    ... @plumbing(YAMLForm, CameFromNext)
    ... class SomeYAMLForm(Form):
    ...     pass


Add forms
=========

Add part
--------

As described in tiles documentation, tiles named ``addform`` are reserved
for application node add forms. They are invoked by the ``add`` tile for the
context returned by the referring node info ``factory``, which could be a vessel
object or a "real life" node - consider this at tile registration. The default
add model factory returns an instance of the class defined in node info
``node`` with adding context set as ``__parent__``.

For creating add form tiles, ``cone.app.browser.authoring.AddPart`` provides
the required plumbings. It derives from ``CameFromNext``.

The ``prepare`` function is plumbed in order to extend the form with a
'factory' proxy widget, which passes the node info name.

The ``__call__`` function gets also plumbed, and renders a heading prior to
form if ``show_heading`` on form tile is set to ``True``, which is default.::

    >>> from cone.app.browser.authoring import AddPart
    
    >>> @tile('addform', interface=ExampleApp, permission="add")
    ... @plumbing(AddPart)
    ... class ExampleAppAddForm(Form):
    ...     pass


Edit forms
==========

Edit part
---------

As described in tiles documentation, tiles named ``editform`` are reserved
for application node edit forms. They are invoked by the ``edit`` tile for
node.

For creating edit form tiles, ``cone.app.browser.authoring.EditPart`` provides
the required plumbings. It derives from ``CameFromNext``.

The ``__call__`` function gets plumbed, and renders a heading prior to
form if ``show_heading`` on form tile is set to ``True``, which is default.::

    >>> from cone.app.browser.authoring import EditPart
    
    >>> @tile('editform', interface=ExampleApp, permission="edit")
    ... @plumbing(EditPart)
    ... class ExampleAppEditForm(Form):
    ...     pass

For add and edit forms it probably makes sense to write one base class
providing the ``prepare`` function.


Settings part
-------------

``cone.app`` renders forms for application settings in tabs, all at once.
To provide a edit form for your settings node,
``cone.app.browser.settings.SettingsPart`` should be used.

The ``prepare`` function gets plumbed which calls
``cone.app.browser.ajax.ajax_form_fiddle`` with form selector in order to
define which of the rendered forms on client side should be altered.

The settings form tile gets extended by a ``next`` function, which handles
form continuation similar to ``CameFromNext`` part, without the consideration
of 'came_from'.::

    >>> from cone.app.browser.settings import SettingsPart
    
    >>> @tile('editform', interface=AppSettings, permission="manage")
    ... @plumbing(SettingsPart)
    ... class ServerSettingsForm(Form):
    ...     pass


Extending forms
===============

The plumbing mechanism could also be used for generic form extension. This is
interesting in cases where a set of different nodes partly contain the same
set of data.

To achieve this, write a plumbing part which hooks to the ``prepare`` function,
which adds form widgets to ``self.form`` after processing ``_next`` downstream
function, which in case is the following ``prepare`` function in the plumbing
pipeline. Also hook to the ``save`` function (the one defined as form action
``handler`` property) and add the related persisting code.::

    >>> from plumber import Part, plumb
    
    >>> class FormExtension(Part):
    ... 
    ...     @plumb
    ...     def prepare(_next, self):
    ...         # downstream ``prepare`` function, after this self.form must
    ...         # be present
    ...         _next(self)
    ...         # extension widget
    ...         widget = factory(
    ...             'field:text',
    ...             value=self.model.attrs['generic'])
    ...         # add new widget before save widget
    ...         save_widget = self.form['save']
    ...         self.form.insertbefore(roles_widget, save_widget)
    ... 
    ...     @plumb
    ...     def save(_next, self, widget, data):
    ...         value = data.fetch('%s.generic' % self.form_name).extracted
    ...         self.model.attrs['generic'] = value
    ...         _next(self, widget, data)

This part can now be used like any other plumbing part for extending form
tiles.::

    >>> @tile('editform', interface=ExampleApp, permission="edit")
    >>> @plumbing(EditPart, FormExtension)
    ... class ServerSettingsForm(Form):
    ...     pass
